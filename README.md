# React SaaS Template
Remains of a SaaS business I once tried to build. Now transformed into a template for building an SaaS/admin application using React + Material-UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js 12+ (versions below could work, but are not tested)

* Linux:

   ```
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

* Windows or macOS:

   https://nodejs.org/en/

### Installing

1. Clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dunky11/react-saas-template
   ```
2. Install dependencies, this can take a minute

   ```
   cd react-saas-template
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local server

   ```
   npm start
   ```

Your browser should now open and show the app. Otherwise open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Editing files will automatically refresh the page.

### What to do next?

If you are new to React, you should watch a [basic React tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=react+tutorial) first.

If you already know React, then most of the information you need is in the [Material-UI documentation](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/).

You can go into [src/theme.js](/src/theme.js) and change the primary and secondary color codes at the top of the script to the values you like and some magic will happen.

## Deployment

If you are happy with the state of your website you can run:

```
npm run build 
```

It will create a folder named build with your compiled project inside. After that copy its content into your webroot and you are ready to go.

## Build With

* [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Used to bootstrap the development
* [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) - Material Design components
* [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - Routing of the app
* [Pace](https://github.com/HubSpot/pace) - Loading bar at the top
* [Emoji-Mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart) - Picker for the emojis
* [React-Dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) - File drop component for uploads
* [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts) - Charting library I used for the statistics
* [Aos](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) - Animations based on viewport
* [React-Cropper](https://github.com/roadmanfong/react-cropper) - Cropper for the image uploads
* [React-Stripe-js](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js) - Stripes payment elements

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
